The CRUD component isn't available yet, but you can upvote [**this GitHub issue**](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/issues/4146) to see it arrive sooner.

Don't hesitate to leave a comment there to influence what gets built.
Especially if you already have a use case for this component, or if you're facing a pain point with your current solution.
