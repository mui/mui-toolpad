# Quickstart

Get started building a Toolpad app!

<p class="description">
This page will guide you into creating your very first Toolpad application. We will create a "hello world" type of application that will ask for a name and print a greeting.
</p>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a running Toolpad instance.

1. Download the docker compose file

   ```sh
   curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mui/mui-toolpad/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. Start the docker compose services

   ```sh
   docker-compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

Toolpad will be accessible under `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Navigating Toolpad

![Toolpad app](/static/toolpad/app-ui-chrome.png)

There are 4 most frequently used areas:

- `Instance editor` - this is there you define and manage pages, connection configurations, custom component definitions, etc...
- `Component's library` - drag component instance from this drawer and drop it in `Application editor` to build UI
- `Application editor` - this is a place where you build your app and immediately preview how it looks like
- `Properties editor` - modify properties of a different instance

## Building your first application

1. Open Toolpad by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

   ![Apps overview](/static/toolpad/apps-overview.png)

1. Click "CREATE NEW" and name your application. Confirm by clicking "CREATE"

   ![Toolpad overview](/static/toolpad/step-1.png)

1. Hover over `Component's library` and drag `DataGrid` and `Image` components into `Application editor`

   ![Drag components](/static/toolpad/step-2.png)

   Congratulations, we are done building the UI! Now all we need to do is connect it with a data source.

1. Click anywhere inside `Application editor` (except on the components that you just added) to deselect added components

1. Locate `ADD QUERY` button inside `Properties editor` and press that to start configuring our data source

   ![Add query](/static/toolpad/step-3.png)

1. This time we are going to use simple `FETCH` type to query our data. Choose and press `CREATE QUERY`

   ![Fetch type](/static/toolpad/step-4.png)

1. Let's fetch some data about dogs from `https://dog.ceo/dog-api` (if you're more of a cat person you could use cat data API from `https://catfact.ninja`. We apologize in advance - following tutorial steps are more suited for the dog data API but should be easily adaptable for cats as well!)

   Use `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all` as a `GET` query `URL`

   Give a unique name to this query i.e. `dogQuery`

   ![Fetch URL](/static/toolpad/step-5.png)

1. Now because data comes in different shapes and forms we provide a quick and convenient way to `transform response` data - `enable` option and use `return data.message` expression

   ![Transform response](/static/toolpad/step-6.png)

   In the response preview pane on the right you can see transformed data will be assigned to `dogQuery`

1. `SAVE` your changes and you will return to `Application editor`

1. Select `DataGrid` component by clicking on it

1. Then locate `ROWS` binding button in the `Properties editor` and click to configure data binding

   ![Bind data](/static/toolpad/step-7.png)

1. Use a `dogQuery` variable available in the scope as a binding expression. Because `rows` property expects `array` type value, we first need to convert `dogQuery.data` (which is object) to array:

   ```js
   Object.entries(dogQuery.data);
   ```

   and click `UPDATE BINDING`

   ![dogQuery.data](/static/toolpad/step-8.png)

1. We have finally connected data source to our UI component!

   ![Connected data](/static/toolpad/step-9.png)

1. Let's make our app a bit more interactive. We want to display an image of a selected breed. Let's create a dynamic query which reacts to the selection inside `DataGrid` component

   - `ADD QUERY` -> create `FETCH` type
   - `name` -> `imageQuery`
   - Add new parameter named `breed`

   ![Breed parameter](/static/toolpad/step-10.png)

   - Bind `breed` parameter value to `dataGrid.selection ? dataGrid.selection[0] : 'akita'` (grabs selected value from `dataGrid` or defaults to `akita` breed)

   ![Breed binding](/static/toolpad/step-11.png)

   - Then bind query `url` property to `https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${query.breed}/images/random`

   ![url binding](/static/toolpad/step-12.png)

   - Last `transform responese` using `return data.message;` and `SAVE`

1. Next we want to display a picture of a selected breed using `Image` component

   - select `Image` component

   - bind `src` prop to `imageQuery.data` and voila - we can preview pictures of a selected breed

   ![Preview image](/static/toolpad/step-13.png)

   Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ we now have an app fetching data from remote source and reacting to the user input!

## Deploying your application

In order to share your application with others you will want to deploy it

1. Locate "rocket" shaped button in the top navigation and press it to initiate creating new release

   ![Rocket button](/static/toolpad/deploy-1.png)

1. Enter `description` of your choice and `CREATE` release

   ![Release description](/static/toolpad/deploy-2.png)

1. Now that you have release ready it's time to `DEPLOY <release name>`

   ![Deploy](/static/toolpad/deploy-3.png)

1. And finally confirm the deployment by clicking `DEPLOY`

   ![Deploy](/static/toolpad/deploy-4.png)

1. You can now see your application is deployed. Click `OPEN` to see the application live

   ![Deploy](/static/toolpad/deploy-5.png)
