# Roadmap

<p class="description">Find out about our plans for Toolpad.</p>

## a change in direction

For the past year that we've been building Toolpad, we've also kept talking to potential users. Having understood the needs better, now it's time to align Toolpad with the insights we've gained over the past months.

### What will change

Toolpad won't be a hosted solution anymore. You will install the Toolpad editor as a regular npm dependency and fully run it locally from within your project folder.

Toolpad applications are stored in configuration files within your project folder, Toolpad won't require access to a database anymore to store its applications. You will be able to hand-edit these configuration files if necessary and the change will immediately reflect in the visual editor.

Toolpad integrates more closely with Node.js backends, you can expose your data to Toolpad by writing regular JavaScript functions, these functions will be able to use any npm package and have access to environment variables available in your project. Now, Toolpad is a more code-friendly way of building applications.

### Why we are changing it

Contrary to traditional low-code tools, we want to provide more degrees of freedom in the areas we don't consider our core functionality. This means you'll be able to use your code editor, version control system, and deployment infrastructure of choice, all the while getting access to simpler workflows to build admin dashboards through visual editors to configure UI and data fetching.

We strongly dislike the lock-in other tools offer, therefore we want to provide built-in powerful customization options. We want to enable a granular transition to real code whenever low-code approach falls short.
