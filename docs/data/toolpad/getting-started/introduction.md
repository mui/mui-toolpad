## How Toolpad works?

- [Build UI](/toolpad/core-concepts/building-ui/) using our drag & drop editor
- [Configure and fetch](/toolpad/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/) data from HTTP endpoints, Google sheets or even directly from Postgres SQL DB
- Connect data with UI elements using [binding expressions](/toolpad/core-concepts/data-binding/)
- When you are ready to share - [deploy](/toolpad/core-concepts/versioning-and-deploying/) a new version
