## Advantages of Toolpad

- **Build faster than ever before:** measure your development time in minutes rather than hours or daysâ€”simply drag and drop the components you need.
- **Extensible with code:** build low-code with pro-code extensibility. You can write JavaScript anywhere in Toolpad as soon as you feel limited by the built-in features.
- **Connect to any data source:** Toolpad lets you work with HTTP endpoints, Google Sheets, or PostgreSQL for backend functionality.
- **Robust versioning and deployment:** use a Git workflow to seamlessly manage deployment and versioning of your app.
