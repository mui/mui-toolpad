## What is Toolpad?

Toolpad is a self-hosted low-code internal tools builder designed to extend the MUI React components. It's designed for developers of all trades who want to save time building internal applications. Drag & drop pre-built UI components, connect your data sources, release your app - and you're done!

## How Toolpad works?

- [Build UI](/toolpad/core-concepts/building-ui/) using our drag & drop editor
- [Configure and fetch](/toolpad/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/) data from HTTP endpoints, Google sheets or even directly from Postgres SQL DB
- Connect data with UI elements using [binding expressions](/toolpad/core-concepts/data-binding/)
- When you are ready to share - [deploy](/toolpad/core-concepts/versioning-and-deploying/) a new version
