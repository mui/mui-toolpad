# Postgres

<p class="description">Postgres query type allows us to fetch data straight from Postgres database</p>

## Working with Postgres

As explained in the [connections](/toolpad/connecting-to-data-sources/connections/) section before you can use `Postgres` query you will first need to setup `connection`

1. Once your `connection` is ready click on `ADD QUERY` in the `Properties editor` on the right

1. Select `Postgres` type and click `CREATE QUERY`

1. In addition we can configure following properties inline

   - On the left side we have a textarea where we can pass `SQL` query

   - On the right side we can query results

1. Once finished with configuration click `SAVE` and click anywhere outside of the dialog to return to the editor
