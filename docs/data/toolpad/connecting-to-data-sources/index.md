# Data fetching

<p class="description">Fetching data into a Toolpad app.</p>

In order to be able to display external data, Toolpad needs to be able to connect to a datasource and execute queries against it.
Toolpad allows you to connect to REST APIs and Google Sheets.

## Data sources

A Toolpad app can connect to different data sources.
To create this connection, click the "+" button next to "connections" in the left menu.
A popup will open where you can pick the type of connection you want to make.

Choose a connection type and click "create". The connection editor will open where you can configure the necessary paramaters for this connection.
