# Deployment

<p class="description">Deploying a Toolpad app is like deploying any other React/Node application.</p>

## Build steps

This command will create an optimized production build for the Toolpad app and will output the generated files:

```sh
yarn build
```

Once the build has been made, you can deploy it to any service of your choice!

To serve the app once built, run:

```sh
yarn start
```
