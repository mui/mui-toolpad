# Data Grid

<p class="description">Learn about how to use data grids in Toolpad.</p>

## Demo

Toolpad builds on top of the [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) to add faster customisation and integration with your internal tools.

{{"demo": "DataGrid.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "inline"}}

## Usage

A Data Grid is an essential component in an internal application. The following properties make it usable to work alongside other Toolpad components, queries, data providers.

### Rows

Rows property requires an array of data to show inside the data grid. It can be configured either by clicking on it and providing JSON or by binding it to a query output. The video below shows how to bind data to data grid using rows linking:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Columns

Columns property is used to configure the columns to be displayed. Choose a column and you'll get a pop-up window to configure its header name, width, alignment and data type.
From the `type` drop down you can also [customize a column](/toolpad/how-to-guides/customize-datagrid/).

### Id field

Id field property is used to identify which column contains the id column. By default, the data grid looks for a property named `id` in the data set to get that identifier. If the row's identifier is not called `id`, then you need to use this prop to tell the data grid where it's located.

### Selection

This property shows the currently selected row or `null` in case no row has been selected. It is available to be bound to take any action on the selected row like [deleting a row](/toolpad/how-to-guides/delete-datagrid-row/) from data grid.

### Loading

Loading property is used to to inform the user when the data is being prepared. It can be [bound to](/toolpad/how-to-guides/delete-datagrid-row/#configure-loading-states-optional) React query properties like isFetching, isLoading.

## Appearance

### `density`

Takes three options: `compact`, `standard` and `comfortable`. The first two are shown below:

#### Compact

{{"demo": "DataGrid.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "inline"}}

#### Standard

{{"demo": "DataGrid_standard.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "inline"}}

### `hideToolbar`

This prop is used to show – or hide – the toolbar from the data grid. The following Data Grid is rendered along with the toolbar, by setting `hideToolbar` to `true`:

{{"demo": "DataGrid_hidetoolbar.js", "bg": "inline"}}
