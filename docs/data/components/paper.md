In practical terms, the elevation controls the size of the shadow applied to the surface. In dark mode, raising the elevation also makes the surface lighter. |
| children | element |  |  |
| sx | object |  | The [`sx` prop](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) is used for defining custom styles that have access to the theme. All MUI system properties are available via the `sx` prop. In addition, the `sx` prop allows you to specify any other CSS rules you may need. |
