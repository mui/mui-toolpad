# MUI Studio

TO DO:

- Add LICENSE (+ in package.json, also update for individual packages)
- docs: How will we do docs? Same as on mui.com? Do we create something new? Do we want to embed them in the app as well?
- `@mui/studio-core` to share types/code between CLI/UI/...: how can we transpile modules with `ts-node`? Probably just use lerna to watch/build them.
- ...
